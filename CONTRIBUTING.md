## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+**
- **Android SDK** with API level 24+ support
- **Git** for version control

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/analytics-annotation.git
   cd analytics-annotation
   ```

2. **Initial Build**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. **Verify Setup**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ./gradlew ktlintCheck
   ```

### Project Structure

The project is organized as a multi-module Gradle project:

```
analytics-annotation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ annotation/     # @TrackScreen, @Trackable, @Track, @Param annotations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/          # Core tracking logic, providers, lifecycle callbacks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compose/       # Jetpack Compose integration (@TrackScreenComposable)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin/        # Gradle plugin for bytecode injection
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/          # Sample application with usage examples
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build-logic/  # Convention plugins for build configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/      # CI/CD workflows and commit conventions
```

### Module Responsibilities

- **`:annotation`** - Annotation definitions only, minimal dependencies
- **`:core`** - Main analytics functionality, lifecycle management, provider pattern
- **`:compose`** - Compose-specific tracking utilities and composables
- **`:plugin`** - Gradle plugin for compile-time bytecode transformation
- **`:app`** - Sample app demonstrating all library features

## üîß Development Workflow

### Building

```bash
# Build all modules
./gradlew build

# Build specific modules
./gradlew :core:build
./gradlew :plugin:build
./gradlew :app:build
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all unit tests
./gradlew test

# Run tests for specific modules
./gradlew :core:test
./gradlew :compose:test

# Run instrumented tests (requires connected device/emulator)
./gradlew connectedCheck

# Run specific instrumented tests
./gradlew :compose:connectedAndroidTest
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Check code style
./gradlew ktlintCheck

# Auto-format code
./gradlew ktlintFormat

# Check for dependency updates
./gradlew dependencyUpdates
```

### Plugin Development

```bash
# Build and publish plugin locally for testing
./gradlew :plugin:publishToMavenLocal

# Test plugin with sample app
./gradlew :app:clean :app:build

# Run plugin-specific tests
./gradlew :plugin:test
```

### Sample App Testing

```bash
# Install and run sample app
./gradlew :app:installDebug
./gradlew :app:run
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### Code Style

- **Kotlin**: Follow [Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html)
- **Formatting**: Use ktlint for automatic formatting (`./gradlew ktlintFormat`)
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables
- **Comments**: Add KDoc for all public APIs

### Architecture Principles

1. **Simplicity First** - APIs should be intuitive and easy to understand
2. **Zero Runtime Crashes** - Analytics should never cause app crashes
3. **Minimal Overhead** - Use reflection caching and lazy initialization
4. **Testability** - Every component should be easily testable in isolation
5. **Documentation** - Every public API must have KDoc comments

### Key Design Patterns

- **Provider Pattern** - `AnalyticsProvider` interface for pluggable analytics services
- **Manager Pattern** - `AnalyticsManager` for coordinating multiple providers
- **Lifecycle Integration** - Automatic tracking via Android lifecycle callbacks
- **DSL Configuration** - Kotlin DSL for library initialization

### Error Handling

- Always use try-catch blocks around analytics code
- Log errors appropriately but never crash the host application
- Provide fallback behavior for critical operations

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Use **JUnit 4** and **Mockk** for mocking
- Use **Robolectric** for Android-specific unit tests
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for core functionality
- Test both success and failure scenarios

### Integration Tests

- Use **Instrumented Tests** for lifecycle behavior verification
- Test real Android components when possible
- Use test doubles like `TestAnalyticsManager` for controlled environments

### Test Organization

```kotlin
class ExampleTest {
    // Given - setup test data and conditions
    // When - execute the action being tested
    // Then - verify the expected outcome
}
```

## üìã Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Create an Issue** - Discuss the change before starting work (for significant changes)
